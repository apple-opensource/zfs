 * Pathname structure.
 * System calls that operate on path names gather the path name
 * from the system call into this structure and reduce it by
 * peeling off translated components.  If a symbolic link is
 * encountered the new path name to be translated is also
 * assembled in this structure.
 *
 * By convention pn_buf is not changed once it's been set to point
 * to the underlying storage; routines which manipulate the pathname
 * do so by changing pn_path and pn_pathlen.  pn_pathlen is redundant
 * since the path name is null-terminated, but is provided to make
 * some computations faster.
